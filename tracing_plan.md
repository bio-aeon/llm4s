# Tracing Architecture Redesign Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the redesign of the LLM4S tracing architecture to provide a more intuitive and structured approach to distributed tracing. The new design moves from imperative event emission to a declarative, hierarchical model with automatic lifecycle management.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems with Current Implementation

1. **No Lifecycle Management**: Current implementation creates spans with both `startTime` and `endTime` immediately, missing the actual duration of operations
2. **Manual Event Creation**: Each tracing call requires manual construction of event objects with UUIDs and timestamps
3. **No Hierarchy Support**: No clear way to create parent-child relationships between spans
4. **Immediate Sending**: Events are sent immediately, preventing batching and optimization
5. **No Context Management**: No way to maintain trace context across method calls or async operations
6. **Limited Metadata Support**: Adding metadata requires manual JSON construction
7. **No Automatic Cleanup**: No guaranteed cleanup of resources if operations fail

### Current API Pattern
```scala
// Current approach - manual and verbose
tracer.traceToolCall("weatherTool", inputJson, outputJson)
tracer.traceEvent("Processing started")
tracer.traceCompletion(completion, "gpt-4")
```

## New Architecture Design

### Core Components

#### 1. TraceManager (Factory)
- Creates root traces with proper initialization
- Manages trace lifecycle and cleanup
- Handles configuration and client setup
- Provides trace registry for context management

#### 2. Trace (Root Container)
- Represents a complete execution flow
- Contains metadata like userId, sessionId, environment
- Manages child spans and their relationships
- Handles final cleanup and event batching

#### 3. Span (Operation Container)
- Represents a single operation with duration
- Supports nesting for hierarchical operations
- Automatic timing with start/end lifecycle
- Metadata and tag management
- Error handling and status tracking

#### 4. SpanContext (State Management)
- Maintains current span context
- Enables context propagation across async boundaries
- Tracks parent-child relationships
- Supports context-aware operations

### New API Pattern

```scala
// New approach - declarative and structured
val trace = TraceManager.createTrace(
  name = "rag-pipeline",
  userId = "user123",
  metadata = Map("version" -> "2.0")
)

trace.span("document-retrieval") { retrievalSpan =>
  retrievalSpan.addMetadata("query", searchQuery)
  
  val embeddings = retrievalSpan.span("query-embedding") { embeddingSpan =>
    embeddingSpan.addTag("model", "text-embedding-ada-002")
    // Operation automatically timed
    generateEmbeddings(query)
  }
  
  val documents = retrievalSpan.span("vector-search") { searchSpan =>
    searchSpan.addMetadata("top_k", 10)
    searchSpan.addMetadata("similarity_threshold", 0.8)
    searchVectorDb(embeddings)
  }
  
  documents
}

// Automatic cleanup and event sending when trace completes
trace.finish()
```

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Timing**: Spans automatically record start/end times
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Nested spans create proper parent-child relationships
3. **Context Propagation**: Spans inherit context from parent operations
4. **Lazy Evaluation**: Events are batched and sent efficiently
5. **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup with try-with-resources pattern
6. **Type Safety**: Strongly typed APIs with compile-time validation
7. **Async Support**: Works with Future/IO operations seamlessly

## Implementation Architecture

### Class Hierarchy

```scala
// Core interfaces
trait TraceManager {
  def createTrace(name: String, userId: String = null, sessionId: String = null, 
                  metadata: Map[String, Any] = Map.empty): Trace
}

trait Trace {
  def span[T](name: String)(operation: Span => T): T
  def addMetadata(key: String, value: Any): Unit
  def addTag(tag: String): Unit
  def finish(): Unit
}

trait Span {
  def span[T](name: String)(operation: Span => T): T
  def addMetadata(key: String, value: Any): Unit
  def addTag(tag: String): Unit
  def setStatus(status: SpanStatus): Unit
  def recordError(error: Throwable): Unit
}

// Implementation classes
class LangfuseTraceManager(client: LangfuseClient) extends TraceManager
class LangfuseTrace(traceId: String, manager: LangfuseTraceManager) extends Trace
class LangfuseSpan(spanId: String, trace: LangfuseTrace, parent: Option[LangfuseSpan]) extends Span
```

### Event Batching Strategy

1. **Deferred Sending**: Events are collected during trace execution
2. **Hierarchical Batching**: Related events are grouped by trace
3. **Configurable Flushing**: Automatic flushing based on time/size thresholds
4. **Error Handling**: Failed events are retried with exponential backoff

### Context Management

```scala
// Context propagation for async operations
implicit val traceContext: TraceContext = trace.context

Future {
  // Automatically inherits trace context
  traceContext.span("async-operation") { span =>
    // Operation with automatic timing
    performAsyncWork()
  }
}
```

## API Design Examples

### Basic Usage
```scala
val tracer = LangfuseTraceManager.create()
val trace = tracer.createTrace("user-request", userId = "user123")

trace.span("llm-call") { span =>
  span.addMetadata("model", "gpt-4")
  span.addMetadata("temperature", 0.7)
  
  val response = llmClient.complete(prompt)
  
  span.addMetadata("tokens_used", response.usage.totalTokens)
  response
}
```

### Tool Execution
```scala
trace.span("tool-execution") { toolSpan =>
  toolSpan.addMetadata("tool_name", "weather_tool")
  toolSpan.addTag("tool_call")
  
  try {
    val result = weatherTool.execute(params)
    toolSpan.addMetadata("result_size", result.toString.length)
    result
  } catch {
    case e: Exception =>
      toolSpan.recordError(e)
      toolSpan.setStatus(SpanStatus.Error)
      throw e
  }
}
```

### Agent Loop
```scala
trace.span("agent-loop") { agentSpan =>
  var iteration = 0
  
  while (!agent.isComplete) {
    agentSpan.span(s"iteration-$iteration") { iterSpan =>
      iterSpan.addMetadata("iteration", iteration)
      
      val planning = iterSpan.span("planning") { planSpan =>
        agent.plan(currentState)
      }
      
      val execution = iterSpan.span("execution") { execSpan =>
        agent.execute(planning)
      }
      
      iteration += 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits of New Design

1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Declarative API with automatic resource management
2. **Better Observability**: Hierarchical traces with proper timing and relationships
3. **Performance**: Batched event sending and reduced overhead
4. **Reliability**: Automatic cleanup and error handling
5. **Scalability**: Configurable sampling and circuit breakers
6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and type safety

## Replacement Strategy

Since the current tracing implementation is not yet in active use, we can completely replace it with the new architecture without maintaining backward compatibility. The existing `Tracing` trait and `LangfuseTracing` class will be removed and replaced with the new system.

## Configuration

```scala
// Configuration options
case class TracingConfig(
  enabled: Boolean = true,
  batchSize: Int = 100,
  flushInterval: Duration = 5.seconds,
  maxRetries: Int = 3,
  circuitBreakerThreshold: Int = 5,
  sampling: SamplingConfig = SamplingConfig.default
)
```

### New API In Production

The new tracing system is now the only tracing implementation in the codebase:

```scala
// New declarative API pattern
val traceManager = TracingFactory.create()
val trace = traceManager.createTrace(
  name = "operation",
  userId = Some("user123"),
  metadata = Map("key" -> "value")
)

trace.span("sub-operation") { span =>
  span.addMetadata("model", "gpt-4")
  // Automatic timing and lifecycle
}

trace.finish()
```

### Migration Benefits Realized
